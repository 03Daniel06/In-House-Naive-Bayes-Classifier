# In-House-Naive-Bayes-Classifier

In this project, I created a Naive Bayes classifier in Python to classify our eight-dimensional data. We have four sets of data, one of which breaks the 'naive' assumption in our model.

## Project Overview

This project is part of my ongoing efforts to build a deeper understanding of machine learning algorithms. Here, I've implemented a Naive Bayes classifier from scratch. The goal is to use this classifier to predict classes in a dataset and evaluate its performance. The project also includes data visualization and performance metrics to analyze classification results.

## Files and Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that runs the Naive Bayes classifier.
- `Data-1-train.txt`, `Data-1-test.txt`, ..., `Data-4-train.txt`, `Data-4-test.txt`: Training and testing datasets.
- `Label-1-train.txt`, `Label-1-test.txt`, ..., `Label-4-train.txt`, `Label-4-test.txt`: Corresponding labels for the datasets.

## Usage

1. **Select Dataset**: The script prompts the user to select which dataset to use for training and testing.
2. **Load Data**: The selected dataset is loaded into the program.
3. **Train Classifier**: The Naive Bayes classifier is initialized and trained using the training data.
4. **Predict**: The classifier predicts the classes for the test data.
5. **Evaluate**: The script calculates and prints the accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Example Usage

To run the classifier, execute the `main.py` script:

```sh
